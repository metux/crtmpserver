crtmpserver (0.0~dfsg+svn611.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    There are several major updates and improvements:
     - RTSP support was completely remade;
     - added MMS support;
     - added HLS support;
     - several improvements in MPEG-TS protocol.

    Package was divided to 4 packages:
     - crtmpserver-libs, with 'thelib' and 'common' inside. Now you do not
       need to install all if you have very customized own build.
     - crtmpserver-apps, default applications which provides by upstream.
     - crtmpserver-dev, headers for 'thelib' and 'common' libs.
     - crtmpserver, main daemon binary and startup scripts.

    Implemented a new system startup for daemon. Upstream configuration file
    was divided to parts: logger configuration script, applications.
